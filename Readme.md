>WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, are mostly always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.

>WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for  use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

>Other datasets collected are the image prediction file found in the udacity web page and the retweet and favorite count got from  analyzing twitter API. These datasets were cleaned and analyzed to gain insights into the data.

>This project is one of the requirements needed for me to pass this course. From the analysis carried out, the Golden retriever, a Dog type has the highest percentage of both favorite count and retweet count. This shows that this dog type is much preferred by individuals.


>Analysis was also carried out on Dog ratings and their relationship with favorite count and retweet count. From the analysis carried out ratings has a positive correlation on both favorite count and retweet count. The higher the count, the higher the ratings. This might be to the fact that the higher the retweet the more people tend to see the tweet more, and the more people visit the page to like the pictures.

>It was a work I got satisfaction doing.
